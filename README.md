# Length Converter

This is a simple web-based Length Converter. It allows you to convert lengths between various units quickly and accurately. 

## Features

- Convert between inches, millimeters (mm), centimeters (cm), kilometers (km), meters (m), micrometers (Âµm), nanometers (nm), miles, yards, feet, nautical miles, and pixels (px).
- Intuitive and clean user interface.
- Responsive design for use on any device.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

4. Input a length in any of the available units, and the converted values in the other units will be displayed automatically.

## Technology

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling
- JavaScript for logic and conversion

## How It Works

Each input field is associated with a different unit of length. When a value is entered into one of the input fields, the JavaScript `convert` function executes. The function takes the entered value, identifies the unit and performs necessary conversions to the other units using predefined conversion rates.
